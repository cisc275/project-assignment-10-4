The purpose of our bird game is to quickly introduce the differences between the migration, eating, and reproduction of the Osprey and Northern Harrier in Delaware estuaries. In the game, the user flies a bird along its migration path, dodging pesky predators and obstacles and capturing prey to get points. Flight speed changes dynamically based upon player success to make it the most fun for the skills of a particular player. Along the way, the user will learn about the bird through interactive and educational quiz questions which power up the bird if answered correctly. After the bird successfully reaches its nest, the player can choose to play the other bird and continue so the fun and learning never stops!
