The goal of this project is to create an educational game about the Osprey and Northern Harrier for the Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve. This game will teach students the differences between a migratory bird and a non-migratory bird in regards to how they travel, the food they eat, predators faced, and reproduction.

The game is intended to be played on a monitor with a resolution of 1080p. To play on other resolutions, the assets may need to be updated.
